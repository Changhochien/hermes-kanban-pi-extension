## Installation

### One-Liner (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Changhochien/hermes-kanban-pi-extension/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# Clone to pi extensions directory
git clone https://github.com/Changhochien/hermes-kanban-pi-extension.git \
  ~/.pi/agent/extensions/hermes-kanban

# Install dependencies and build
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/hermes-kanban
npm install && npm run build
```

> ⚠️ After installing, restart pi agent to load the extension.

## Usage

### As Orchestrator

```bash
# List available agents/profiles
pi "What Hermes profiles are available?"

# List ready tasks
pi "What tasks are ready for work?"

# Create a task for a specific agent
pi "Create a task for the researcher to analyze competitors"

# Create a task, let pi pick the right agent
pi "Create a task to write unit tests. Figure out which agent is best suited."

# Monitor board
pi "Show me the current kanban board"

# Link tasks for pipeline
pi "Create a research task and link it to the synthesis task"
```

**Orchestrator Workflow:**
1. `kanban_profiles` — Discover available agents
2. `kanban_list` — See what tasks exist and who's assigned
3. `kanban_create` — Delegate work to a specific agent
4. `kanban_link` — Set up dependencies between tasks
5. `kanban_diagnostics` — Monitor for stuck tasks

### As Worker

When launched with `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK=t_abc123`, the extension automatically:
- Injects task context into the system prompt
- Detects completion signals and suggests `kanban_complete`
- Provides `kanban_worker_context` tool for self-awareness

```bash
# Launch as Hermes worker
HERMES_KANBAN_TASK=t_abc123 pi --mode json

# Send heartbeat during long operations
pi "Send a heartbeat for my current task"
```

### Multi-Board

```bash
# List available boards
pi "What boards are available?"

# Switch board
/kanban-switch research

# Use specific board in any tool
pi "List the ready tasks on the production board"
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HERMES_HOME` | `~/.hermes` | Hermes config directory |
| `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` | `default` | Default board name |
| `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` | — | Current task ID (set by Hermes) |
| `HERMES_KANBAN_AUTO_COMPLETE` | `0` | Auto-complete on detection (not recommended) |
